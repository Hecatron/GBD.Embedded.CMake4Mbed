For mbed there are 2 top level scripts

build.py - builds the mbed library with different options added (such as ethernet, usb)
           generates a static library we can link into our own project

make.py -  builds test projects for testing on the new chip

gcc flags are defined within toolchains\gcc.py
flags are set during the constructor of the GCC class which inherits from mbedToolchain

we need to focus on settings.py
1. look at build options for adding additional headers for the Atmel Arduino Due target
2. I think we can use one of the scripts further up the chain from toolchains\gcc.py
to get the cflags we need for compiling via cmake
