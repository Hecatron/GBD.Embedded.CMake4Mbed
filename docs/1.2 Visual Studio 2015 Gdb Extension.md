# 1.3 Visual Studio 2015 Gdb Extension

## Overview

Still trying to get this to work at the moment
it was something included originally as part of 2015 RC, but it's not in the latest 2015 RTM version of Visual Studio
according to the website they plan on including it in future versions of 2015 though
below are some rough notes on how far I've got

## Downloading the Extension

First we need to download MIEngine

 * https://github.com/Microsoft/MIEngine

  cd D:\SourceControl\GitExternal\
  git clone https://github.com/Microsoft/MIEngine.git

this should clone the git repo locally
I'm curently trying this with commit 1b69c86e1f17ccc1b0e0631a1c5c671f0f0e1bf8 as of writing

## Extension Setup

### Building the Extension

Next we need to build the Extension

 * Open up the MIDebugEngine.sln file within src using Visual Studio 2015
 * Right Click Build and wait a while
 * Next we click on Debug this should generate the vsix file we need, then launch a 2nd copy of Visual Studio

At this stage a 2nd copy of Visual Studio should now start to launch with the extension loaded
There will probably be an error that pops up, I just clicked Ok to ignore it then Continue to carry on

We should now have a 2nd version of VS launched
The extension should show up under
Tools -> Extension and Updates "Micrsoft MI-based Debugger"
close down this 2nd copy of VS

### Installing the Extension

If your feeling brave you can try and install the generated extension file into your main copy of VS
within the MIEngine\src\MIDebugPackage\bin\Debug\ directory there should be a file
**Microsoft.MIDebugPackage.DoNotInstall.vsix**

hmm do not install
nothing ventured nothing gained
my guess is it's probably marked do not install since it's planned to be included by default in a future version of VS 2015
also because it potentially could have bugs that could crash VS out

## Visual Studio Setup

### Setting up an XML Configuration File

Next we need to setup a xml file to let Visual Studio know which options to use when attempting to connect via gdb

The MIEngine website recommends first opening up the MICore/LaunchOptions.xsd file within Visual Studio
This way while we're creating our new options file VS will validate the file (highlight any problems)
and provide intellisense to completing the fields

Create a new file inside the project directory
This seems to partially work but it throws up a large number of errors while debugging

vsgdbconfig.xml

<LocalLaunchOptions xmlns="http://schemas.microsoft.com/vstudio/MDDDebuggerOptions/2014"
 TargetArchitecture="ARM"
 MIDebuggerPath="D:\SourceControl\GitRepos\GBD.Embedded.DotMbed\deps\gcc-arm-none-eabi\bin\arm-none-eabi-gdb.exe"
 MIDebuggerServerAddress="127.0.0.1:3333"                    
 MIMode="gdb"
 ExePath="D:\SourceControl\GitRepos\GBD.Embedded.DotMbed\src\HelloWorld-LPC\LPC1347\HelloWorld.elf"
 >

  <SetupCommands>
    <Command>
      target extended-remote :3333
    </Command>
    <Command>
      set remotetimeout 60000
    </Command>
    <Command>
      set mem inaccessible-by-default off
    </Command>
    <Command>
      mon ondisconnect cont
    </Command>
    <Command>
      set arm force-mode thumb
    </Command>
  </SetupCommands>
  
</LocalLaunchOptions>


### Launching GDB WIthin Visual Studio

Next assuming we're using the LPC Xpresso board, open up the Samples Solution
Run the following

  Debug.MIDebugLaunch /OptionsFile:HelloWorld-LPC\vsgdbconfig.xml /Executable:HelloWorld-LPC\LPC1347\HelloWorld.elf

  Debug.MIDebugLaunch /OptionsFile:HelloWorld-STM32\vsgdbconfig.xml /Executable:HelloWorld-STM32\NUCLEO_F103RB\HelloWorld-STM32.elf
  Debug.MIDebugLaunch /OptionsFile:D:\SourceControl\GitRepos\GBD.Embedded.CMake4Mbed\src\HelloWorld-STM32\vsgdbconfig.xml /Executable:D:\SourceControl\GitRepos\GBD.Embedded.CMake4Mbed\src\HelloWorld-STM32\NUCLEO_F103RB\HelloWorld-STM32.elf

## TODO

The below is an alternative bunch of settings I've tried but doesn't work at all
TcpLaunchOptions just hangs with "Initializing Debuggger"

<TcpLaunchOptions xmlns="http://schemas.microsoft.com/vstudio/MDDDebuggerOptions/2014"
    Hostname="127.0.0.1" Port="3333" Secure="false" TargetArchitecture="arm">
</TcpLaunchOptions>

The LocalLaunchOptions seems to give partial sucess (the closest I've got to it working)
ut throws up a lot of errors during debug / seems unstable still at this point
I think I need to experiment with passing in additional commands like I do with the gdb command line client
