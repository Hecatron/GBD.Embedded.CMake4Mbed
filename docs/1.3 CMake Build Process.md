# 1.3 CMake Build Process

## Overview

These are still rough notes at the moment
See the HelloWorld-LPC Project for an example setup

## File Layout

To begin with looking at the HelloWorld-LPC project as an example
the following files are part of the cmake build process

  CMakeLists.txt - root cmake file for the project
  cmake\build.py - python build script
  cmake\BuildOptions.cmake - user settable options for cmake to build the project
  cmake\ProjectFiles.cmake - list of source files / include directories / targets for the project
  cmake\ToolChainOptions.cmake - toolchain script parsed by cmake

### BuildOptions.cmake

The cmake\BuildOptions.cmake file is a user settable file to specify options such as which mbed targets
to compile for and which toolchain to use.
It's included twice, once during the parsing of the toolchain options by cmake
and second during the parsing of the main CMakeLists.txt file in the source root

#### CMake Mbed Directory

The most important option is the location of the CMake4Mbed directory

  set (CMAKE4MBED_DIR "${CMAKE_CURRENT_LIST_DIR}/../../..")

The variable CMAKE_CURRENT_LIST_DIR can be used to reference the path to the current script file
(in this case the BuildOptions.cmake file

#### Toolchain target

The next option specifies which toolchain to use.

  set(TOOLCHAIN "armgcc")

Typically I've only tested this with gcc, to see which options are available see the file
<cmake4mbed>/lib/cmake/CMake4Mbed_toolchain.cmake

 * armgcc - use arm gcc for the toolchain
 * armcc - use Arm CC for the toolchain
 * custom - allows you to set your own targets for the linker / compiler

#### TODO

 * mbed device targets
 * mbed lib features


So far I've only tested with with gcc so I can't guarantee armcc will work

### ProjectFiles.cmake

The ProjectFiles.cmake file defines which .c source files to include, and which include directories to use
and which target .elf files to generate
I hope in the future to add support for auto generating this file from the Visual Studio project file
For now it has to be edited by the user to match against the source files within the Visual Studio project

## CMake Build Process

### Python build script

The first step in the build process, is the calling of **build.py** within the **cmake** directory
This script first deletes then re-creates an empty Build subdirectory within the source tree

The next step is that cmake is called to generate the required files for building the project
we pass in an option to set the file cmake\ToolChainOptions.cmake to be parsed as the toolchain script
also the working directory is set to the Build subdirectory when running cmake

The options to look out for within this script include

 * CMAKE_GENERATOR = "NMake Makefiles" - specifies which type of makefiles to generate
 * BUILD_CMD = ["nmake"] - specifies which command to run to build the sources within the Build directory

On a windows environment with Visual Studio, NMake is included as part of the Visual Studio package so is probably the better option
you can also try Ninja for the Ninja build tools, or one of the other cmake generators listed via cmake --help

### CMake Toolchain Processing

One of the first actions cmake takes and this is before it even process's the CMakeLists.txt file
is to look at the toolchain file which we've set via

  -DCMAKE_TOOLCHAIN_FILE=cmake/ToolChainOptions.cmake

Becuase we're potentially cross compiling for a different target we need to override the options
for the compiler and linker

cmake/ToolChainOptions.cmake is parsed first, this script just pulls in the settings from the
cmake\BuildOptions.cmake file (where cmake4mbed is located, and the selected toolchain to use)
then it runs the setup macro within lib/cmake/CMake4Mbed_toolchain.cmake

### CMake Main build script

The next step is that cmake now processes the CMakeLists.txt file at the top of the source tree
this file

 * includes the user settable build options cmake/BuildOptions.cmake
 * includes the cmake script <cmake4mbed>/lib/cmake/CMake4Mbed.cmake
 * includes the project specific options file cmake\ProjectFiles.cmake

This is an out of source build, located within the Build subdirectory
CMake4Mbed.cmake does most of the work required for setting up the build environment

## TODO

 * Finish off toolschain scripts under lib/cmake4mbed
 * build options - mbed device targets
 * build options - mbed lib features to include
 * make sure python scripts are v3 compatible

 * ProjectFiles.cmake python generation script (from vs project file)
 * export targets python script

 * test under linux
 * test with directories with spaces in the name

 * add condition to use ninja-tools when in linux environment
 * add ninja-tools build to bin directory
