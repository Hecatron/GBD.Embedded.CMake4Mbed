# 1.1 Source Project Files

## Overview

For this setup we're going to use Visual Studio 2015 with a C++ Makefile / NMake type project
The makefile type project within Visual Studio allows you to use external tools to build the project

The plan here is to use Visual Studio for editing the code and to try and use the new Visual Studio 2015 gdb feature
for debugging (similar to VisualGDB)

But handle the compilation via external tools / makefile / gcc
I'm hopeful that as part of this I can re-write the makefile glue logic from gcc4mbed to use something like
cmake / ninja-tools / .Net app to extract source files from the C++ VS Project file etc
perhaps even some libs to handle uploading / calls to a Segger / LPC Link
to make things a bit more automated

also project templates as well

## List of source files

Something to be aware of is that whenever you want to add an additional .c or header file to the project
it needs to be added into 2 places currently

  * The Visual Studio Project, used for editing code / Debugging via gdb
  * The MakeFile used for the compilation

## Creating a New VS Project

### Creating a new VS Solution

First Create a New Solution to hold the project

  * File -> New Project
  * Select Other Project Types -> Visual Studio Solutions -> Blank Solution

One annoying thing VS does is create a new subdirectory for the solution. so usually I just close the solution
then move it to where I want it under windows explorer then re-open it again

### Creating a new VS Project

Next we're going to add a new project to the solution

  * Right Click the SOlution in the Solution Explorer
  * Select Add -> New Project
  * Select Other Languages -> Visual C++ -> Makefile Project

### Adding the Include Directories

Strictly speaking VS doesn't handle any compliation, but adding header directories is good for intellisense
There's 2 places we want to add include directories

  * Richt Click Project -> Properties -> VC++ Directories -> Include Directories
  * Richt Click Project -> Properties -> NMake -> Include Search Path

Typially we want to add something like the following

  * D:\SourceControl\GitRepos\GBD.Embedded.DotMbed\deps\gcc-arm-none-eabi\arm-none-eabi\include
  * D:\SourceControl\GitRepos\GBD.Embedded.DotMbed\deps\mbed\libraries\mbed\api
  * D:\SourceControl\GitRepos\GBD.Embedded.DotMbed\deps\mbed\build\mbed\TARGET_LPC1347
  * D:\SourceControl\GitRepos\GBD.Embedded.DotMbed\deps\mri

TODO change to relative links / look at other missing symbols

## Setting up makefiles for compilation

TODO stil working on this, look at the makefiles under HellowWorld-LPC for an example
the most important part is specifying which devices to build for in the makefile
and disable mri

  PROJECT         := HelloWorld
  DEVICES         := LPC1347
  GCC4MBED_DIR    := ../../
  NO_FLOAT_SCANF  := 1
  NO_FLOAT_PRINTF := 1
  GCC4MBED_TYPE   := Release
  MRI_ENABLE      := 0

  include $(GCC4MBED_DIR)/oldmake/gcc4mbed.mk

## Debugging

One of the new features in VS 2015 is the ability to connect to GDB Servers for debugging
this was included in VS 2015 RC (Release Candidate) by default
but it looks like they've not included it in the latest RTM release

 * https://github.com/Microsoft/MIEngine
 * http://blogs.msdn.com/b/vcblog/archive/2015/04/29/debug-c-code-on-linux-from-visual-studio.aspx
 * https://github.com/Microsoft/MIEngine/wiki/Start-debugging-other-platforms-using-the-MIEngine
 * https://github.com/NETMF/llilum/wiki/demo

TODO the below is not yet tested, I need to get the plugin working first

### Creating an xml file

Create an xml file called vsgdbconfig.xml
this will tell MIEngine how to connect to the GDB Server

  <TcpLaunchOptions xmlns="http://schemas.microsoft.com/vstudio/MDDDebuggerOptions/2014"
      Hostname="127.0.0.1" Port="3333" Secure="false">
  </TcpLaunchOptions>

  * Select View->Other Windows->Command Window within Visual Studio
  * Run the following in the command window

Run the following
the path is relative to the location of the solution file

  Debug.MIDebugLaunch /OptionsFile:HelloWorld-LPC\vsgdbconfig.xml /Executable:HelloWorld-LPC\LPC1347\HelloWorld.elf

## TODO

  * Look at the makefile build process
  * Try and get the gdb support working in VS 2015 RTM
