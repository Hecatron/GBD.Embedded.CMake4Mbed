# Deployment - USB Drop

## Overview

One of the features of the LPC Devices is that they can be set to a mode
where they present themselves as a USB Flash drive, it's then possible just to drag and drop the flash file
onto the device as a way of programming it

TODO I think the device has to be reset and certain pins need to be pulled low for this to work, look into this further
