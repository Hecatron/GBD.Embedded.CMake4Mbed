# 1.0 Downloading Dependencies

## 1,1 Python Modules

The python scripts under bin make use of certain python modules which can be installed by pip under windows

For the DownloadDeps.py script:

  pip install wget
  pip install colorama colorlog

  cd C:\Python34
  python.exe -m pip install wget
  python.exe -m pip install colorama colorlog

## 1.2 The Atmel Software Framework (ASF)

The files required for any Atmel devices for mbed should already be located within other directories
however if an ASF archive file is detected within the deps\Archive\ directory
it will be auto extracted into the directory deps\atmel-asf

ASF stands for the Atmel Software Framework
If you want to port any SAM ARM related devices to mbed (like the SAM3X), then this is a good starting point

download the file from this link, and place it into deps\Archive\

## TODO Below








## 1.1 Downloading the .Net Dependencies

The build scripts make use of .Net to handle logging / downloads etc
The first step is to download a series of .Net dependencies that the scripts will be using

Under Windows:

  cd bin
  DownloadDeps.cmd

Under Linux:

  cd bin
  DownloadDeps.sh

This should trigger Nuget to download a series of .Net libs into the deps/ directory



## 1.3 Downloading the Toolchain

For the next step we're going to download the gcc toolchain and the mbed base library

  cd bin
  DownloadToolChain.cmd TCSettings_win32.xml

Under Linux:

  cd bin
  DownloadToolChain.sh TCSettings_linux.xml

This should download gcc and mbed and extract under deps\

## 1.3 The Options file

By default DownloadToolChain will look for a xml file called TCSettings.xml for which settings to use for the download
I haven't set this up just yet but the plan is to use a different file for windows / linux
which file is used can be overriden by passing in the name of the xml file as the first parameter
by default the script wil look for TCSettings.xml
