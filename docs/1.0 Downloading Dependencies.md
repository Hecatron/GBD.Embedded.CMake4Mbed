# 1.0 Downloading Dependencies

## 1.1 Downloading the .Net Dependencies

The build scripts make use of .Net to handle logging / downloads etc
The first step is to download a series of .Net dependencies that the scripts will be using

Under Windows:

  cd bin
  DownloadDeps.cmd

Under Linux:

  cd bin
  DownloadDeps.sh

This should trigger Nuget to download a series of .Net libs into the deps/ directory

## 1.2 The Atmel Software Framework (ASF)

I haven't got to the point where I'm using it yet but as part of the download script
I've included support for extrcting the ASF or Atmel Software Framework (ASF) since I'm pretty sure it's needed
to get Atmel devices working with mbed like the Arduino due SAM3X processor

download the file from this link, and place it into deps/Archive/
http://www.atmel.com/tools/avrsoftwareframework.aspx?tab=overview
This way when we run the toolschain download script the archive will be extracted into /deps/

## 1.3 Downloading the Toolchain

For the next step we're going to download the gcc toolchain and the mbed base library

  cd bin
  DownloadToolChain.cmd TCSettings_win32.xml

Under Linux:

  cd bin
  DownloadToolChain.sh TCSettings_linux.xml

This should download gcc and mbed and extract under deps\

## 1.3 The Options file

By default DownloadToolChain will look for a xml file called TCSettings.xml for which settings to use for the download
I haven't set this up just yet but the plan is to use a different file for windows / linux
which file is used can be overriden by passing in the name of the xml file as the first parameter
by default the script wil look for TCSettings.xml
