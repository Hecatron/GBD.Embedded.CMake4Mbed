# This variable gets propagated to the parent scope and is ultimately used in
# the top-level CMakeLists.txt to define the dependencies for the build target.

# Files within this list are relative to the current folder.
# Please also note that this macro must be used at all CMakeLists.txt files at
# intermediate levels even if the list is empty--this is due to the Cmake magic
# involved in propagating variables to only the parent scope.
